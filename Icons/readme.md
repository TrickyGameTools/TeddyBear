# Icons

These are the icons used by TeddyBear... Well it's all the same.
Whoever drew this teddybear is not known to me, it was a public domain clip art, suitable for this project.

The .ico file is used in this actual project.
I included the .icns file in case you plan to bundle it all as a Mac Application Bundle, since icns is the standard Mac icon format, however I am pretty done with Mac myself (and since Mac deprecated OpenGL (idiots), TeddyBear will soon not work at all anyway, not even with Mono installed), but if you have a use for it, here it is :P

Since the icons were public domain from the start, I cannot claim copyrights over them, so here they are if you like them :P
